## 📂 Repository Structure  

### 📘 `learning/`  
This folder contains my **notes** and **homework-style mini projects**, where I practice concepts while learning Python fundamentals.  

### 💡 `projects/`  
This folder contains my **major projects**, where I apply my skills in more practical and fun ways.  
Some examples include:  
- 🎲 **Dice Rolling Game** – simulates dice rolls with random outcomes

📝 Learn Python basics well → I want to get better at the fundamentals like variables, loops, functions, and more.

📚 Keep track of my learning → This repo is my notebook where I save notes and code so I can come back and review anytime.

💻 Build projects step by step → Start with small games and tasks, then move to bigger, more advanced projects.

🤖 Explore Python in AI & automation → In the future, I want to see how Python can be used in Artificial Intelligence and automation tools.
